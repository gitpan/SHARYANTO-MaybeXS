NAME
    SHARYANTO::MaybeXS - Do task using a non-core XS module, but provide
    pure-Perl fallback

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use SHARYANTO::MaybeXS qw(clone uniq);

     my $clone = clone({blah=>1});

DESCRIPTION
    This module helps when you want to bootstrap your Perl application with
    a portable, dependency-free Perl script. In a vanilla Perl installation
    (having only core modules), you can use App::FatPacker to include
    pure-Perl dependencies to your script. This module provides fallback for
    some tasks that usually need to be done using a non-core XS module.

FUNCTIONS
  clone($data) => $cloned
    Try to use Data::Clone's "clone", but fallback to Storable's "clone".
    Note that currently Storable can't handle Regexp object out of the box.

  uniq(@ary) => @uniq_ary
    Try to use List::MoreUtils's "uniq", but fallback to using pure-Perl
    implementation.
