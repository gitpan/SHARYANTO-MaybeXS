NAME
    SHARYANTO::MaybeXS - Do task using non-core XS module, but provide
    pure-Perl/core fallback

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use SHARYANTO::MaybeXS qw(clone uniq);

     my $clone = clone({blah=>1});

DESCRIPTION
    This module helps when you want to bootstrap your Perl application with
    a portable, dependency-free Perl script. In a vanilla Perl installation
    (having only core modules), you can use App::FatPacker to include
    pure-Perl dependencies to your script. This module provides fallback for
    some tasks that usually need to be done using a non-core XS module, by
    providing alternatives using pure-Perl or core XS module.

FUNCTIONS
  clone($data) => $cloned
    Try to use Data::Clone's "clone", but fallback to Clone::PP's "clone".

  uniq(@ary) => @uniq_ary
    Try to use List::MoreUtils's "uniq", but fallback to using pure-Perl
    implementation.

SEE ALSO
    Clone::Any can also uses multiple backends, but I avoid it because I
    don't think Storable's "dclone" should be used (no Regexp support out of
    the box + must use deparse to handle coderefs).
